# Suite

All transitions are set to `none` in order to ensure that all elements of
interest always look the same and are not captured somewhere in the middle.

Furthermore, the table of contents is hidden for all tests layed out on this
page, as it is sometimes shown within the drawer though it isn't activated.
This seems to be a caching-related issue.

<style>
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    transition: none !important;
  }
  .md-nav--secondary {
    display: none !important;
  }
</style>
