With the growing importance of personal digital fabrication in academia and other contexts, universities are challenged to think about how to best develop teaching and research opportunities in such domains. This is not a trivial process because personal digital fabrication transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries and requires infrastructures as well as skill, competence and organizational structures that are, to an extent, non-traditional in academic contexts.

The goal of project FAB101 is to work on such considerations based on a research infrastructure of four (Fab) Labs at German universities. From 2017-2020, the four research groups hosting the Labs will analyze and compare prior experience of ‘their’ Labs as well as do reviews of the state of the art and carry out empirical work such as the co-development of new, experimental, interdisciplinary and inter-university educational formats in the domain of personal digital fabrication.
